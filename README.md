# echartsCopy
this is just a copy of the eCharts R interface package developed by Yihui Xie:

https://github.com/yihui/recharts

The reason why this copy is held up here is because when I was trying to deploy a simple Shiny application with reference to the pacakge made by Yihui there's a versioning problem that I could only get v0.0.3 (based on E-charts 2) from github.
